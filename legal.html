          <p>You understand that we save your drawing and IP address on our servers, and that we use cookies to identify you.</p>

          <p>If you share your email address with us, we will only use it to email you information about this project, and we will not share it with anyone.</p>
          <p>If anything goes wrong, it's not our responsibility to fix it. This includes the project getting canceled, your drawing being lost, your computer breaking, the Andy rover not landing safely on the Moon, or the end of the world.</p>

          <h2>Moon Drawings Terms of Use</h2>
          <h5 class='subhead'>(Effective as of April 15, 2015)</h5>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'>Welcome to the <em>Moon Drawings</em> service (the “Service”). The following Terms of Use apply when you view or use the Service via our website located at <a href="index.html">http://www.moondrawings.org</a>. Please review the following terms carefully. By accessing or using the Service, you signify your agreement to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you may not access or use the Service.</p>
          <h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'>The Service creators (the "Team") respect the privacy of the Service users. Please refer to the Team’s Privacy Policy (<a href="privacy.html">found here</a>) which explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that pertains to your privacy.  When you access or use the Service, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h4>ABOUT THE SERVICE</h4>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'>The Service allows you to create a single line drawing for submission to an art project, in which such user-submitted drawings are etched in a physical medium and sent to the Moon, as part of the Moon Arts project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).</p>
          <h4>REGISTRATION; RULES FOR USER CONDUCT <br />AND USE OF THE SERVICE</h4>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Age Restrictions:</strong> Visitors to this site may be exposed to unfiltered, user-generated content. For this reason, you must be at least 13 years old to register for and use the Service.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Limits on Contribution:</strong> You may only create a single drawing using this service.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Inclusion of Submitted Drawings:</strong> Any or all submitted drawings may be included in the final <em>Moon Drawings</em> project, and the final <em>Moon Drawings</em> project may or may not be included aboard the Astrobotic/CMU Moon mission. We offer no guarantees that any submitted drawing will be included in the project, nor that any submitted drawing will actually make it to the Moon.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as browsing. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. The service may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites or sign into our Services. <em>Moon Drawings</em> uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> The <em>Moon Drawings</em> project uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various databases and web pages, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as the drawings made when you interact with the Service.</p>
          <p class='mumbo-jumbo'><strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Moon Drawing's rights or property. However, nothing in our Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>
